# Regina's Recreational Rentables
We have been contacted by a company that wants us to develop a website that will allow people to get into contact with renters for sports equipment in Regina. Renters will be able to create listings, upload images of equipment, set prices and indicate the dates of availability. The listing must be approved by the admins before it is uploaded to the website. Users looking to rent will be able to browse listings and send a request form to the renter for the item they are interested in. This form will be sent to the renter through email. There will be three types of users: non-registered users, registered users and the admin.
